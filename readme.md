# CentaNH
§bCentaNH§r is a fork of GTNH edited to have 100x quest rewards, made for fun.

Alongside having 100x quest rewards, this fork does a few other minor things:
- Shop cooldowns have been removed
	- Shops keep their original prices
- Lootbag tradeup costs have been scaled
	- eg 300 LV bags -> 100 MV bags

## Installation
Simply paste the contents of the overrides folder into your GTNH instance's .minecraft folder.
 
## Credits
A fork of standard expansion created specifically for CentaNH development by Ven, that did most of the heavy lifting.
